From this belief, he developed a high-performance speaker cable, called Monster Cable, and literally created an industry.\n\nMonster has since grown from a hobby business in Lee’s garage into a globally recognized brand of consumer electronics and accessories that manufacturers and markets approximately 4,000 different product types in over 80 countries worldwide.\n\nMonster’s extensive product range includes headphones, audio, video and Ethernet cables, surge protectors and more.",
